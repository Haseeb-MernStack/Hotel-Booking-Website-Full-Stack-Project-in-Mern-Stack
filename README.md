# QuickStay Hotel Website

This project, **QuickStay**, is a full-stack hotel booking application. Currently, I have built the frontend using **React.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Clerk** for authentication. The backend will be added in the future to make this project even more awesome!

## Project Routes

Below is a list of routes used in the project. You can check out the code for route setup in the `App.jsx` and `main.jsx` files.

### Frontend Routes

- `/` - Home page
- `/hotels` - List of hotels
- `/hotels/:id` - Hotel details page
- `/booking` - Booking page
- `/login` - User login page
- `/register` - User registration page

### Backend API Routes (Planned)

- `GET /api/hotels` - Fetch all hotels
- `GET /api/hotels/:id` - Fetch details of a specific hotel
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create a new booking
- `GET /api/bookings` - Fetch all bookings
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration

## Current Status

At this time, I have built just the **frontend** for this project. The backend will be developed later to complete the full-stack functionality.

## Made with ❤️
